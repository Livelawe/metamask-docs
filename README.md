💡 Why sponsor this project

This repository is more than just a fork of MetaMask’s documentation — it’s a living knowledge base built from deep research, real debugging, and hands-on interaction with Web3 wallets.
I maintain and expand it so developers and security-minded users can understand how MetaMask works under the hood — from key storage to RPC architecture and dApp permissions.

Your sponsorship helps me:
	•	keep documentation updated as MetaMask evolves,
	•	add real-world examples and code snippets that make it easier for others to build safely on Ethereum,
	•	continue researching and publishing findings that make Web3 more transparent and accessible.

If you’ve ever learned something here, saved hours of debugging, or found clarity in a confusing crypto world — that’s the impact your support sustains.
