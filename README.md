This repository is a **full copy** of the official [MetaMask Developer Documentation](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-docs).  
It is being preserved here by **Fabian Lawergren (Livelawe)** in order to  
keep the original commit history and files accessible to the public.

> from the MetaMask and ConsenSys teams.

## 🧭 Why This Exists

This fork was originally created in an attempt to understand and trace technical issues  
related to my own digital security situation.  
By coincidence, it turned out to include one of the most complete and intact versions  
of the MetaMask Docs repository.

I decided to leave it public because it may be useful for others who want  
to explore how large-scale Web3 documentation is built and maintained.
