# 📘 MetaMask Docs – Complete Fork Preserved by Fabian Lawergren

🧭 Comparable Forks & Historical Context

Over 1,500 developers have forked the original MetaMask/metamask-docs.
However, very few forks have preserved the complete commit lineage from the early documentation era.

🏛️ Why Fabian Lawergren’s Fork Is Unique

This repository — Livelawe/metamask-docs — preserves a near-complete snapshot of the official MetaMask Docs, including:
	•	1322 full commits, capturing the project’s evolution up to late 2024
	•	All early developer contributions, including SDK, Snaps, and Wallet API references
	•	A verified commit signature by the maintainer (Livelawe)
	•	A clean, traceable history before MetaMask’s 2024 documentation restructuring

This makes it one of the most historically intact forks of the MetaMask documentation ever published —
serving as a reference state for developers, researchers, and AI projects studying early Web3 SDK evolution.

🤖 AI Enhancement Era (2025)

As of October 2025, this fork is being extended with AI indexing and browser-based question-answering capabilities —
creating the world’s first self-hosted AI layer for the MetaMask documentation.

This enhancement, known as MetaMask AI Docs, allows users to ask natural language questions,
retrieve answers with verified sources, and interact with preserved Web3 knowledge — directly in the browser,
without any external APIs or paid services.



## 🧭 Why This Exists

This fork was originally created in an attempt to understand and trace technical issues  
related to my own digital security situation.  
By coincidence, it turned out to include one of the most complete and intact versions  
of the MetaMask Docs repository.

I decided to leave it public because it may be useful for others who want  
to explore how large-scale Web3 documentation is built and maintained.
